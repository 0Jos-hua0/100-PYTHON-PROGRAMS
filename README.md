# Python Learning Repository: From Basics to a Decision Tree

A comprehensive collection of 100 Python programs designed as a structured learning path. The repository begins with fundamental concepts like variables and loops and progresses to more advanced topics, culminating in a complete machine learning project using a decision tree.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run any program from the respective folders, e.g., `python 1_fundamentals/hello_world.py`.

## Repository Structure

- `1_fundamentals/`: Programs 1-20 covering basic Python syntax and concepts
- `2_data_structures_and_functions/`: Programs 21-40 focusing on data structures and function implementation
- `3_intermediate_concepts/`: Programs 41-60 exploring more complex programming concepts
- `4_data_science_and_analysis/`: Programs 61-80 introducing data science and analysis with Python
- `5_machine_learning_and_decision_trees/`: Programs 81-100 focusing on machine learning concepts and decision tree implementation

## Requirements

All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
